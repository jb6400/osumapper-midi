# osumapper-midi

This is a variation of the original osumapper by kotritrona that uses MIDI files to generate .osu files instead of .mp3 files. 

So far, the code is able to convert initial .mp3 to wav to MIDI file using WAON. The osumapper is able to recognize this MIDI file.

Next is to train the data and see the results and work from there.
